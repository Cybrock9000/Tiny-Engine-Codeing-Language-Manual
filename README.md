# Tiny-Engine-Codeing-Language-Manual
I made the code easy to learn and use so everyone can create there own game but you can only have 50 lines of code for each game

I am going to release the game on v1 and it it currently b0.5

# REMEMBER SOME OF THE STUFF IN THE GAME ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED/WORK LIKE:
1. The new button does not really work
2. Some of the code
3. slots 2 and 3 for open goes strate to 1
# Stuff I want to add:
1. Better menu
2. More Code

# Code
1. tx:, ###, = Displays text
2. spr, ###, = Loads a sprite and draws them (so far there is only 'player')
3. spx, ###, #, = Sets a sprites x pos
4. spy, ###, #, = Sets a sprites y pos
5. drw, = Everything drawn gets put on display
6. var, #, #, = Uses one of the 20 variables and sets it (YOU CANT DO ANYTHING WITH THESE ''YET'')
7. glp, #, = Starts the gameloop and type (IS NOT IMPLEMENTED ''YET'')
8. wat, #, = Waits # secs
9. but, #, #, = If button pressed (a or b) and wich one and what code to do (This will varry depending on what gameloop you use) (IS NOT IMPLEMENTED ''YET'')
